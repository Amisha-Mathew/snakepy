# snakepy
Predictive model for detection of snake species to classify them as venomous or non-venomous using deep learning models. CNN model using pandas, numpy, seaborn and Tensorflow keras.

The next model is implementation of CNN algorithm using tensorflow-keras model.

ResNet50 is used as the base model. Pretrained ImageNet weights are used for the model.
Adam optimizer is used for stochastic gradient descent for training  the deep learning model.

The model is run over 50 epochs to achieve the results.
The accuracy builds up from 53% and goes till 71.8% in the process.
